# The EXPENSES MANAGER

## Description

This project is a simple one to show that we know how to code in JavaScript. We are especially interested in the use of the Ramda library , which is the whole purpose of the functional programming course that we took.

## Meaning 

Even though the project is pretty small, we decided to do something *MEANINGFUL* and *USEFUL* in our day to life lifes! And what best to do than something that has to do with money, that we can change throughout the day,the week, the month or even the year!

## More Details

As we said this project is developed using Javascript and Ramda . However we wanted to have something kind of presentable , meaning wee had to use a teeny tiny bit of HTML/CSS.
